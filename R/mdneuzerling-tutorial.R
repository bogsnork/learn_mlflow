### mlflow
#
# function for logging model hyperparameters as MLflow parameters. This function
# will only log hyperparameters set by the user, since the default values have a
# NULL expression, but I think that this approach makes sense. It also passes on
# the input workflow unmodified

log_workflow_parameters <- function(workflow) {
  # Would help to have a check here: has this workflow been finalised?
  # It may be sufficient to check that the arg quosures carry no environments.

      mlflow_log_param(parameter_name, parameter_value)
    }

  workflow

# log metrics. The input to this function will be a metrics tibble produced
# by the yardstick package, which is a component of tidymodels:

log_metrics <- function(metrics, estimator = "standard") {
  metrics %>% filter(.estimator == estimator) %>% pmap(
    function(.metric, .estimator, .estimate) {
      mlflow_log_metric(.metric, .estimate)
    }
  )
  metrics
}


# store artifacts with each run. These are usually models, but could be
# anything. MLflow supports exporting models with the carrier::crate function.
# This is a tricky function to use, since the user must comprehensively list
# their dependencies. For a workflow with a recipe, itâ€™s a lot easier. All of
# the preprocessing is contained within the recipe, and the fitted workflow
# object contains this.


# I haven't yet defined fitted_coffee_model, so I won't run this
